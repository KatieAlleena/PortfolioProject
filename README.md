4. Other minor updates such as correct paths for local links.
5. Added art logo from instagram. Added it to the correct html page. Added CSS to circle crop that. 
6. Added linkedin/facebook profile photo.Added this to the index html file. Added title div and included the google font I chose. Did not resize the large photo intentionally.
7. On art projects html file, I made use of curatior.io widget to embed my instagram feed. I also linked my instagram on that page; one can click the logo or any of the widget images to be brought to the official page. I also updated the necessary css for margins, etc.
8. Added a header to most pages in order to match the index html file.
9. Added a programmer meme to one of my pages to fill space.

5. Minor content updates across multiple pages.
6. Changed the site background to reuse an asset I acquired for a different project.
